      "review = the film is about a young man, michael, who cares for the elderly. one day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his clients. around the same time he decides to model his killing after the zodiac killer of the 60's. he gets in touch with the author of a book about the zodiac killer and they form a friendship. michael has a gun (aparently the only gun, as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors, only not portrayed as the same gun.) and he goes out a-killin'. original. this is a great film if you like b movies. i thought the idea of the movie was good, but the editing and the acting really drowned the plot. i thought the 'blood' was just too fake, the lighting was horrible in some places, and the dialog was just too standard. the movie was shot on video, which is okay, but the editing of the film just made for some weird 'plan 9' scenes. not a bad movie for fans of the b-movie genre, but if you want something with a bit more polish, move on to something else.\n",

      "review = first of all this was not a three hour movie - two hours, ten minutes... last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie! perhaps, though, it should've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours? yeah, would have gotten more in, been able to explore some more emotion. overall, though, it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi. i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography, never knew anything about their lives off the screen. because of this movie i do now but i'm not so sure that's a good thing. everything here no one really needed to know. this was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made. but it was made and the reason is because lucy & desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars. that is definitely so not true and very, very sad.anyway, what was shown here in lucy was pretty good. two complaints - the actress who played viv vance - not great casting at all. and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york.... uhhh, like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person!? that wasn't too great. but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy & desi. no, the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said, this focused mainly just on lucy & desi. had there been more time, had the story been more about lucy's entire life, then maybe the kids woulda been there more. but they weren't so we got to see the likes of gable & lombard, red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead. wow, that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool: his presence and influence in lucy's life. really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more. oh well. what was explored was done well, for the most part. honestly, i don't think i'll ever watch this again and i don't think this movie'll be that memorable. for someone who digs i love lucy but isn't an enormous lucille ball fan, this should be an interesting watch. my grade for this: b\n",

      "review = funny how many of the people who say this is far superior to romero's version tend to be very young (judging by their other posts). what we have here is a slick, action packed, gory and \"whoopee\" filled 2 hour mtv video. frantic editing, pop-video camera work, \"cool\" music blah blah blahactually it ain't bad compared to other recent remakes (chainsaw massacre was a total disaster)... pretty good acting all round, totally predictable in the \"who will die next\" stakes and a total cash in on the dawn of the dead name that will generate plenty of revenue alone by fans of the original who will go and see it out of curiosity...don't remakes of classics get on your nerves? can they really not come up with something original? why remake dawn of the dead? the things that made the original special (the middle segment kids think is so boring is supposed to be slow to show how when you get everything you ever wanted you still ain't happy) are totally missing. this is an action flick, plain and simple. the faster the better. if you are into action flicks (and as this, the 2004 version is well done) fair enough, but for anyone who likes a little substance to their films... get ready to sigh (again)...watch the cinemas over the next few years as we get the godfather series remade by whoever the most fashionable pop director is at the moment, and star wars remade, with all the kids saying how the new version is miles better cos the old version is slow and boring and holds a camera shot for more than 5 seconds...not bad, but in 10 years they will still be discussing the romero version, not this pap\n",

      "review = i saw this film in its entirety in the 1960s & 70s, yes it is gruesome, and could be the progenitor of the \"faces of death\" series popular in the 80s & 90s. considering the state of so-called \"driver education\" these days, this one should be required viewing for everyone preparing to learn to drive. when you see violent death in all its gore & horror, you certainly (if you have any sensibility at all) get a truer perspective on the responsibilities required to drive safely, what one instant of thoughtlessness or inattentiveness at the wheel can do. i worked for bell telephone in the 70s & 80s, and at one point was assigned to conduct a safety class. i found this film in the company library, showed it at the session, a number of people got physically sick and had to leave the room! incredibly, most of them later said \"i never knew a car accident could be so terrible!\" this film, and another, \"red asphalt\", is certainly reality in its most graphic form. i'll never forget it, i only wish i could have found a copy when my children were attending \"driver's ed\" in high school!\n",

      "review     = my giving this film a score of 8 is relative to other feature-length films from 1930. by the standards of films made just a few years later, this film might receive a score of only 6 or 7--mostly because the sound quality was so poor. now it is possible that the film sounded better and the fox movie channel did show a degraded print (it did have a lot of lines and scratches), but i assume the sound problem was always an issue. that's because sound in movies was still a novelty in 1930 and many of the hollywood talking pictures of 1930 sounded terrible--with background characters often drowning out the leads, characters huddled together to make sure they are picked up by the microphones or inconsistent quality (such as what was seen in the bishop murder case, hell's angels and other films of the day). this was all made much worse in the big trail because most of the film was shot outside--something unheard of at the time. quite an innovation but also something that really stretched the talents of the sound technicians! so, while the film was very hard to listen to, i realize that they had to start somewhere, so i can forgive this--especially since the outdoor scenes are breathtaking--a major innovation for 1930.the plot is rather similar to cimarron--a western that came out the following year and which captured the oscar for best picture. unfortunately, cimarron isn't all that great a film and i actually like the big trail more due to the scope of the film. while some might balk at the big trail's slow-moving pace, i saw it as a great history lesson about the hardships endured by those traveling west on wagon trains. plus, the whole thing just looked so beautiful, as director raoul walsh went to significant trouble to film on location and the big trail looks almost like a film version of some ansel adams prints.as for the acting, it was pretty good. this was a major break for young john wayne--as his previous screen appearances were, at best, minor and unremarkable. here, he was given the lead and did a dandy job--though he was obviously young and a little less \"john wayne-ish\" than he was in later films, as his screen persona was not yet firmly established. another interesting part was played by tyrone power ii (tyrone power's father). he looked nothing like his extremely handsome son and looked and sounded almost exactly like bluto from the popeye cartoons! he made very few sound films--dying just a year after making this film--so it's a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor.overall, the film is well worth seeing despite some sound problems and a few overly long scenes here and there. for 1930, it was a remarkable achievement--more so than the much more famous and award-winning cimarron made the following year. much of the reason the big trail didn't win an oscar most likely was because all quiet on the western front came out the same year and it is truly one of the great films.\n",

      "review     = this relic from before the days of the production code and the hays office is good fun, not great but entertaining.based on a song by rogers & hart that was an enormous hit at the time, the story revolves around dance hall girl barbara stanwyck who is romanced by wealthy businessman ricardo cortez (who was indecently handsome), but whose heart belongs to her bookish neighbor monroe owsley. she and owsley marry, but keep it a secret, while she dismisses cortez, who still holds out hope. she helps hubby get a job in cortez's company, but married bliss quickly turns sour as owsley develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college sweetheart and gambles in high-stakes bridge (yup! i know, it's pretty funny....). finally he embezzles $5,000 from cortez, and is about to go on the lam, when his devoted wife goes to cortez....and i won't reveal anything else, although the ending was certainly a surprise.stanwyck is the best thing about this movie; in one of her earliest roles she's quite accomplished. owsley is the weak point; he's unattractive and sniveling, while cortez is amazingly suave and sexy, while his performance is earnest but unremarkable.while ostensibly a drama, it's filled with laughs, many inadvertant as some elements of this movie have aged very poorly. but there are a lot of good witty lines; at one point stanwyck says to cortez, \"my brains are in my feet, while yours are in....\" that's pretty darn suggestive for 1931! there's a lot of bawdy and suggestive stuff in this flick, in the last days before the code clamped down and whitewashed everything. an amusing antique, a good reminder of how far we haven't come in 70 years....this story could very easily be changed to fit 2003 but could keep the basic plot, with the original ending, in place.\n",

      "review     = i first saw the victim (aka out of contention) well over 25 years ago when i was very young. being a passionate fan of bewitched since i was a child, i loved to watch anything that starred elizabeth montgomery. this movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of miss montgomery's work or not. elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in a case of rape and as the suspected murderess in the legend of lizzie borden. her performance in the victim as kate, a terrified woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm, with a killer after her is brilliant. if you like exciting suspenseful thrillers than this is one movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end. another great performance well worth mentioning is that of eileen heckhart who plays the eerie and suspicious housekeeper. unfortunately like most of miss montgomery's movies, the victim is not available on dvd and i believe that although it was released on vhs some years ago, it is a rarity these days. i was lucky to have taped it when it was aired on television some ten years ago and so have a nice copy of this very good movie. a must see!\n",

      "review     = i'm a collector of films starring ms. weaver, so i bought this only because of her being in it. i find it really odd that her early career is filled with so many awful movies. she started with incredible promise in alien but then had a slew of bombs. these bombs include this movie, deal of the century, one woman or two, and half moon street. she also appeared in the year of living dangerously, which was not a bomb, but her performance was less than notable. in the time between alien and it's 1986 sequel, aliens, the only movie she did that was worth anything was ghostbusters. before the release of aliens, i'm sure everyone thought this woman was on her way out. luckily she wasn't.back to eyewitness though, the film is boring. it doesn't create any suspense. william hurt seems like a cardboard stand in, and the atmosphere is just to dry. sigourney is decent but nothing worth remembering.watch this movie if you must but don't go in with any expectations of a decent movie. watch better movies with these two stars like accidental tourist and working girl.\n",

      "review     = visconti's death in venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made. while watching, we acknowledge we are in the hands of a visionary genius. endlessly opulent death in venice surely is; but in other important ways, it's an unsatisfying film. thomas mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von aschenbach's literary career and output; of his imperious manner, his layer-upon-layer of programmed, self-conscious behavior. when tadzio appears and obsession arises, it's evident that aschenbach hasn't the slightest idea who he is beneath his gilded-age trappings and carefully lived life. in fact, upon seeing tadzio, the 'solitary,' as mann sometimes calls him, splits in two. aschenbach no. 1 absorbs the sight of a beautiful 14-year old boy, then attempts to intellectually process the giddy jolt in blood pressure as he would a work of art - a 'divine' work of art. but aschenbach no. 2, emerges as a stalker who takes control of, then replaces, the rational aschenbach no. 1. like the original aschenbach, his sexual-doppelganger is mortified to make human contact with the object of his obsession - and thus tadzio remains a far-off ideal. thomas mann has no mercy for this game. every shred of self knowledge comes too strong and too late; the excitement of sexual flush is too great to resist. that venice is gripped by disease means nothing to aschenbach - except that his game now has higher stakes. when he finally whispers beneath his breath 'i love you,' he knows that all is lost, and the abyss awaits. is any of this filmable? perhaps, and visconti creates a visual feast impossible to look away from. but there are errors: he and dirk bogarde create aschenbach as sympathetic; mann, again, did not. aschenbach's pov dominates the film and we are expected to identify. but nowhere on screen is there a man being torn apart from within. bogarde toggles between the sublimely controlled and the ridiculously temperamental with ease - but what's underneath? bogard's reactive performance has no mooring. mann writes a character who is, in his imagination, doing the dance of the seven veils, all too aware of the consequences such freedom invites, yet unable, unwilling to resist. also, visconti's screenplay creates a character not in the original - alfred, a friend of aschenbach's - to dramatize mann's discussion of art and artists. these scenes are badly written disasters, and the actor who portrays alfred is difficult to watch. also, visconti's aschenbach is a gilded-age teutonic composer, which i think works for the film; and the symphonies of mahler substitute for aschenbach's novels. mahler's great music unfortunately is badly recorded and very badly played. so death in venice, as visconti hands it to us, is not the complete success it might have been, but as a purely visual experience its power cannot be denied. all students of film, especially cinematography, will want to take a look.\n",

      "review     = poor jane austen ought to be glad she's not around to see this dreadful wreck of an adaptation. so many great jane austen movies have come out recently that this one deserves to be permanently buried along with two other movies i despise-the man in the gray flannel suit and the 1969 version of david copperfield. my main beef with the movie is that it completely misses the point of the book. jane austen was poking fun at the gothic mania in her society, and much of the novel is tongue in cheek. the movie, however, is serious and comes across terribly melodramatically. the lighthearted, fun-poking flavor of austen's writing is completely and conspicuously absent from this ponderous foray iinto horror meets period drama. the scenes of catherine's imagination are both gratuitous and uninteresting. also, henry tilney is dreadfully unappealing. why, i ask, would anyone fall for him? if you are looking for a fun-filled jane austen evening, watch emma instead!\n",
